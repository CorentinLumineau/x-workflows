## Usage

Skills activate automatically based on context. Reference them when needed:

- **Planning**: x-plan (brainstorm, design, analyze modes)
- **Implementation**: x-implement (implement, fix, refactor, improve, cleanup modes)
- **Verification**: x-verify (verify, build, coverage modes)
- **Review**: x-review (review, audit modes)
- **Git**: x-git (commit, release modes)
- **Debugging**: x-troubleshoot (troubleshoot, debug, explain modes)
- **Deployment**: x-deploy, x-monitor

## Workflow Patterns

**Feature Development:**
```
x-plan → x-implement → x-verify → x-review → x-git
```

**Bug Fix:**
```
x-troubleshoot → x-implement fix → x-verify → x-git
```

**Multi-Session:**
```
x-initiative create → x-initiative continue → x-initiative archive
```
